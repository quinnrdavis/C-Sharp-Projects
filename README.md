### Car Insurance
ASP.NET app using MVC and Entity Framework with a database first workflow. This web app imitates a car insurance website with a form for users to enter their policy information and recieve a calculated quote. There is also an admin page that allows an administrator to view all quotes that have been issued.

### Price Quote
A console app that mimics order input for a shipping company. It takes user input of package info, determines if the package is too heavy or too large to ship, and calculates a quote.
